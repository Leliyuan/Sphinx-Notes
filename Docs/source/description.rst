AWES Functionality Description
===============================

AWES (Autonomous Wind Energy System) is designed to harness wind energy efficiently by using advanced kite dynamics. The system is capable of adjusting its flight path to optimize energy capture and provide a stable power output. Below are the key functionalities of the AWES:

Key Functionalities:
====================

* **Kite Dynamics Control**: The system autonomously controls the kite's flight path to optimize energy capture based on wind conditions.

* **Energy Conversion**: Converts the kinetic energy from the kite's motion into electrical energy.

* **Adaptive Flight Path**: The flight path of the kite adapts to changing wind speeds and directions, ensuring consistent power generation.

* **Power Stabilization**: The system maintains a stable power output by adjusting the kite's position relative to the wind.

Kite Dynamics Control
---------------------
The kite dynamics control system is responsible for ensuring the kite follows an optimal flight path based on real-time wind measurements. It uses advanced algorithms to steer the kite and optimize the angle of attack, maximizing energy efficiency.

Energy Conversion
-----------------
AWES features a highly efficient energy conversion system that captures the kinetic energy generated by the kite's motion through tether cables and transforms it into usable electrical power. The system operates in both high and low wind conditions, ensuring stable energy generation.

Adaptive Flight Path
--------------------
The system's flight path is continuously adjusted based on wind speed and direction. The kite's position is monitored and controlled to ensure that it remains in the optimal flight envelope for energy capture, even during gusts or changes in the wind profile.

Power Stabilization
-------------------
AWES includes a power stabilization mechanism that ensures a steady output despite fluctuations in wind speed. This is achieved through real-time control adjustments of the kite's orientation and tether length to minimize power variability.

Example of Kite Dynamics Control Algorithm:
-------------------------------------------
.. code:: python

   def control_kite_position(wind_speed, angle_of_attack):
       # Algorithm to control kite position based on wind speed
       if wind_speed > 15:
           return "high"
       else:
           return "low"
